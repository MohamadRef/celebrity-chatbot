# Eminem Chatbot

## Overview
This project features a chatbot that simulates a conversation with the iconic rapper Eminem. The chatbot engages users by asking about their favorite songs and albums, as well as their listening habits. It aims to provide an entertaining and interactive experience while showcasing the personality of Slim Shady.

## Features
- Interactive conversation with the user
- Questions about favorite Eminem songs and albums

## How It Works
1. The chatbot introduces itself and explains that it will ask a few questions.
2. It asks the user about their favorite Eminem song:
   - If the user mentions "love" or "lose yourself", the chatbot responds with an enthusiastic acknowledgment.
   - For other songs, it expresses appreciation for the user's taste.
3. Next, it inquires about the user's favorite Eminem album:
   - If the user mentions "marshall mathers" or "the slim shady", the chatbot praises the choice as one of the best albums.
   - For other responses, it acknowledges Eminem's diverse discography.
4. Finally, the chatbot asks how many minutes the user listens to Eminem daily, responding with enthusiasm for higher listening times and encouragement for lower ones.
5. The conversation concludes with a friendly thank you from Slim Shady.

## Code Structure
- The code is written in Python and uses basic input and output statements to interact with the user.
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) are utilized to generate responses based on user input.
